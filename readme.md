# Parry Knight Mod

This mod was created with the following principles:
- Only parrying will damage parryable enemies.
- Only spells will damage non-parryable enemies.

In order to make a full-game playthrough possible, aspids and False Knight are unaffected by the above until a spell is acquired.

Parryable enemies will typically take much longer to kill. **An enemy health bar mod is strongly recommended.**

The following enemies are parryable, meaning at least one of their attacks can be parried:
- Broken Vessel
- Brooding Mawlek
- Brothers Oro & Mato
- God Tamer
- Great Husk Sentry
- Great Nailsage Sly (except in phase 2)
- Grimm
- Heavy Fool
- Heavy Sentry
- Hive Knight
- The Hollow Knight
- Hornet Sentinel
- Husk Miner
- Husk Sentry
- Husk Warrior
- Kingsmould
- Lost Kin
- Mantis Traitor
- Mantis Warrior
- Moss Knight
- Myla
- Nightmare King Grimm
- Paintmaster Sheo
- Pure Vessel
- Shade
- Shielded Fool
- Soul Warrior
- Stalking Devout
- Sturdy Fool
- Traitor Lord
- Watcher Knights
- Winged Fool
- Winged Sentry

Every enemy not listed above must be killed with a spell.
